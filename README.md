# FDMSWEB Project

This project aims to develop a website using C#. It will have similar functionalities compared to MyAnimeList.com (a.k.a MAL - which is also used as a template/reference to design) but with only limited core functions, such as view, search and add animes to list.

> Additional basic functions that enable users to log in, register and view their profiles are as well included.

> This is used as an assignment project in university, and is a part of a bigger project called Film Database Management System, which includes a ASP.NET website for clients (FDMSWEB) and a separate WinForms application (FDMSAPP) for admins.

* Written in C#, with ASP.NET MVC and Bootstrap Frameworks on Visual Studio Community 2019 version 16.7.7.
* Database engine is InnoDB (MySQL).
